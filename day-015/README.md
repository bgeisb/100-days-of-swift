## ðŸ“’ Field Notes

This was the last day designed around reviewing the material of days 1-12, so I won't rehash everything that was written in those folders. There was, however, an additional word search puzzle consisting of 50 Swift-related terms.

I placed the puzzle grid and the terms side-by-side in Photoshop and proceeded from there. If you'd like to use the same assets, you can find the PS file in this directory &mdash; alongside PNG assets containing the start and end states of the puzzle.
