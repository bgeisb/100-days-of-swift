## 📒 Field Notes

This day was designed around reviewing the material of days 1-12, so I won't rehash everything that was written in those folders. Needless to say, Swift is a lovely language &mdash; clean, safe, strongly typed, object-oriented _and_ functional, and powerful &mdash; and I _really_ want keep writing in it ❤️.
